# Why these component?
| Component     | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Config        | To provide a simple way for handling configurations and reloads on configchange Viper is directly included. Viper is not optimized for speed but for comfortability  |
| DB            | Postgres is mature, Cockroachdb is extremly scaleable but both speak the postgres protocol, this provides an common sql syntax with the possibility to scale  |
| Log           | Fastest Logger by [benchmark](https://github.com/rs/zerolog#benchmarks) |
| Router        | The Router is a Trie Based router with a ÎŸ(\|s\|) Complexity with s being the length of the string |
| Server        | Fasthttp is the fastest http-server for golang [benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) and uses an optimized flate and gzip implementation [compress](https://github.com/klauspost/compress)|
| View          | jinja2 familiar Syntax And fastest templating without precompilation to golang [benchmark](https://github.com/SlinSo/goTemplateBenchmark#full-featured-template-engines-1) |
